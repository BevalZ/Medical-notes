# [Intra-aortic Ballon Pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intra-aortic_balloon_pump)

```
Increase cardiac output --> Increase coronary blood flow --> Increase myocadial oxygen perfusion

pproximately 2 centimeters (0.79 in)

## Mechanism

### Actively deflates in systole

Increasing forward blood flow by reducing afterload through a vacuum effect.
### Actively inflates in diastole


Increasing blood flow to the coronary arteries via retrograde flow.

## Indications

- Cardiogenic shock(心源性休克)
- Reversible intracardial mechanical defects complicating infarction（反流性心脏缺陷合并梗死，如二尖瓣反流、室间隔穿孔）
- unstable angina pectoris（不稳定性心绞痛）
- post cardiothoracic surgery（心胸手术术后，最常用于心肺搭桥手术）
- Preoperative use is suggested for high-risk patients such as those with unstable angina with stenosis greater than 70% of main coronary artery, in ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction less than 35%.
- Percutaneous coronary angioplasty
- In high risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery where cardiopulmonary bypass time was shortened, as well as during intubation period and hospital stay.
- Thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction

## contraindication

### absolute contraindication

- Sever aortic valve insufficienty
- Aortic dissection
- Severe aortoiliac occlusive disease and bilateral carotid stenosis

### relative contraindication

- Prosthetic vascular grafts in the aorta
- Aortic aneurysm
- Aortofemoral grafts
- Sepsis
